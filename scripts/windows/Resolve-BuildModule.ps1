#requires -Version 7.0

# Copied verbatim from ANTfrastructure
# `shared/windows/templates/Resolve-BuildModule.ps1` — do not hand-edit; sync
# from upstream instead. This is the one build-tooling file that cannot be
# imported out of the submodule, because it is what *finds* the submodule: it
# runs before anything upstream is importable.
#
# Contract (third_party/ANTfrastructure/docs/adopting-in-a-new-project.md § 1):
#
#   1. third_party/ANTfrastructure/windows/scripts/modules/<Name>.psm1
#   2. <this script's directory>/modules/<Name>.psm1   (project-specific fallback)
#   3. throw, naming BOTH probed paths
#
# That preference order is the whole point: put a module upstream and it wins
# automatically, so this repo never silently keeps building against a stale
# vendored copy. Keep ONLY genuinely project-specific modules in the local
# fallback directory.
#
# LOCAL DELTA vs the template: this header block, and nothing else. Everything
# from `Set-StrictMode` down is byte-identical to the upstream file.
#
# That was NOT true before the 2026-09-15 ANTfrastructure migration: this copy had
# fallen 16 body lines behind canonical — the `.ps1` arm of Resolve-BuildModule,
# which is what makes Initialize-CiEnvironment.ps1 reachable at all, and the
# dot-source guard in Import-BuildModule. Nothing could see it, because the only
# claim of freshness was the word "verbatim" in this header.
#
# So the claim is now MACHINE-CHECKED instead of asserted. This copy is registry
# row `resolve-build-module` (body mode) in ANTfrastructure
# `shared/config/shared-assets.manifest`, declared in `.antfrastructure-shared.manifest`
# at this repo's root. Only this header prose and the VALUE of
# $script:RepoRootRelativeToHere are local; every other line is compared:
#   bash third_party/ANTfrastructure/shared/config/sync-shared-config.sh --repo-root . --check
#
# The template's "ADJUST $script:RepoRootRelativeToHere" note does not apply
# here - this script does sit exactly two directories below the repo root, so
# the upstream default (two levels up) is already correct.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Resolves and imports build modules into the caller's global session.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Imports with -Force -Global, in the order given. List modules in
        DEPENDENCY ORDER (WindowsScripts.Shared and WindowsBuild.Common first):
        ANTfrastructure's modules pull their own dependencies in with a plain,
        guarded Import-Module, so one forced top-level import gives every module
        the same copy, whereas forcing a dependency *after* its dependents can
        yank it back out of the global session state — the shadowing pitfall
        WindowsCMake.Common's header warns about.

    # WindowsScripts.Shared ALWAYS, whether or not the caller named it.
    #
    # A nested `Import-Module` inside a .psm1 binds into THAT MODULE'S private
    # scope; it does not reach the importing session. So a script that imports
    # only WindowsBuild.Common gets Write-BuildLog but NOT Resolve-WorkspacePath,
    # Add-DirectoriesToPath or the other Shared exports WindowsBuild.Common
    # itself depends on — verified 2026-08-11: `Get-Command Resolve-WorkspacePath`
    # comes back empty in exactly that setup. Every consumer hit this and
    # "fixed" it by remembering to list Shared first; doing it here means they
    # cannot forget. Shared is dependency-free, so the extra import is safe in
    # any position and costs one small module load.
