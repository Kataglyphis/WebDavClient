#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run-lint-gates.sh - this repo's lint gate: the hub lint aggregator over the
# tracked tree, every gate running even after one fails, with the verdict
# raised once at the end.
#
# A wrapper around ANTfrastructure's linux/scripts/run-lint-gates.sh, which owns
# the six gates (listed in its header), their pinned + SHA-verified bootstraps,
# the git-ls-files scope construction, the empty-scope vacuity guards and the
# secret-scanner self-test (an empty tree must scan clean, a planted PAT must be
# reported at the path that was passed in - otherwise "no findings" cannot be
# told apart from "the scanner never started").
#
# THIS CLOSES A GAP, IT DOES NOT REPLACE ANYTHING. Before this file, the whole
# repo had no shell, workflow or secret linting at all: grepping the tracked
# tree outside third_party/ for any of the three tool names found exactly one
# hit, and it was a disable directive (SC1090) inside lib/antfrastructure.sh - a
# suppression for a linter that never ran.
#
# The roundabout phrasing above is not accidental: a comment line whose FIRST
# word is the shell linter's own name parses as a DIRECTIVE, and one it cannot
# parse is itself an SC1073/SC1072 error - a gate that fails on its own wrapper.
#
# The consumer root is passed EXPLICITLY. Upstream refuses to infer it, and
# must: this script's hub half lives inside third_party/ANTfrastructure, so a
# root derived from its own location would grade ANTfrastructure's tree and
# report green over the wrong repo.
#
# --exclude defaults to third_party upstream, which is what this repo wants:
# third_party/ANTfrastructure is a submodule graded in its own repository at its
# own ratchet.
